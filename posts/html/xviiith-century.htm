</header>

<p> Recently I got interested in some parts of Polish history, which I think are
  quite relevant to what we've been seeing in the world in recent years.
</p>

<p> In XVIIIth century Poland by unfortunate decisions and aspirations of the
  King Augustus II the Strong came under the influence of Russia.  Almost all
  XVIIIth century Polish monarchs and influential aristocratic families
  were trying to reform the country, strengthen its weak political system and
  get out of dependence on Russian tsars. Unfortunately without success.  The
  Polish kings weren't able to reform the financial system, nor did a military
  reform or change systemic weaknesses.
</p>

<p> This led to three partitions of Poland in 1772, 1792 and 1793 after which
  the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania ceased to exist.  Its territories
  were split into three neighbouring powers: Russia, Prussia and Austria.
</p>

<p> At least until the beginning of 1990 the understanding of this period
  was partial, which is rather a mild statement.  Historians had only access
  to Prussian, Austrian and Polish documents from the XVIIIth century, but the
  lack, as it turns out the most important part of the picture: the Russian
  side.  At that time the only available Russian narrative was available from
  Sergey Solovyov.  However he wasn't interested in answering the question of how
  the partition of Poland was achieved, he was creating a narrative to support
  the imperial interests of Russia.  A narrative which pushed the responsibility
  for the Russian conspiration far away from its source.
</p>

<p> Historian's understanding of that period dramatically changed when Russian
  archives in Moscow started to be available.  It turned out that the first
  partition of Poland wasn't achieved through Prussian and Austrian domination,
  but through intricate diplomatic play, manipulation of Polish society and
  bribes done by Russian ambassadors.  Russians played an active role, and
  concluded that inviting Prussia and Austrian to take part in it is
  a small and acceptable price to pay to keep Poland under its sphere of
  influence and project a powerful image to the Western countries of its
  domination in the region.
</p>

<p> The secret documents show that Russian doctrine towards Poland was to keep
  the Polish crown in the hands of a weak, somebody who is devoted to the tsar, with no
  strong connections to European aristocratic families, preferably somebody of
  weak intellectual abilities.  It didn't work that well, but certainly, Polish
  kings were heavily constrained.  In 1974, Tsar Catharina II came up with yet
  another way of introducing her influence over the Polish political scene.  She
  wanted to install a Russian party in disguise, which could be used to
  directly influence parliamentarian sessions.  This party was supposed to be
  created by non-Catholics.  For that, Russia requested that all non-Catholics
  would have equal political rights.  Something unheard of in all European
  countries at that time.  It's also worth noting that at that time Poland was
  one of the most friendly countries for many religions, although not without
  problems.  It's also worth mentioning that Russia didn't bother with such
  rights and freedoms on its soil. However, it was also very useful for
  creating a narrative about how modern the young at the time Tsar Catharina
  II was.
</p>

<p> Thanks to open Russian archives the process which led to the first
  partition in 1772 is known in great detail.  Whenever a short-term strategy of
  influence was not working Russians changed their ambassador and adapted
  their strategy, sometimes leaving the ambassador open doors to improvise
  (something that Vlad Vexler explains quite well in his
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VladVexlerChat">youtube channel</a>).
  Sometimes using bribery, playing various Polish institutions
  against each other.  What was surprising for historians is that the biggest
  Russian threat was an exaggerated fear of French influence.  Because of the strong
  statement of the Polish king Russians considered dethroning the king, but they
  feared the chaos of a free election (Polish Kings were elected by the noble
  class). This could lead to unpredictable consequences.  Polish King at that
  time was able to negotiate hard since Russia was at war with Turkey.  In the
  end tsar allowed Prussia and Austria to the table.  In a secret letter
  Cathrine II suggested that she's ready to abandon Russian guarantees of
  Polish borders.  That was a clear signal for Prussia, as it was looking
  forward to territorial gains for a long time without much success.
</p>

<p> The XVIIIth century contains many other very interesting moments, where
  Russia used all their playbook tricks: spreading fear and misinformation,
  bribery, army movements (e.g. moving out to release tension, just to come back
  shortly) or being very careful to not even show a shadow of weakness at the
  European geopolitical scene.   For example, the biggest threat to the Polish
  noble class (the only class that had political rights), was the Polish King
  for historical reasons.  Hence the liberum veto: a tool to break
  a parliamentarian session without making any progress.  Until the XVIIIth century,
  it was only used to defend the rights of the noble class, who were more
  afraid of bad reforms than not making progress with good ones.  But in
  XVIIIth century that proved to be one of the primary weaknesses strongly
  defended by tsars and used against Poland.
</p>

<p> There were other weaknesses of Poland at that time.  One was the treasury
  system.  The taxes were not high enough to reform the country, provide good
  administration and have a modern army.  The
  noble class had fears that raised taxes would stay forever, more than the
  Russian or Prussian armies were stationed in the country, although eventually due
  to rapes and robberies, the climate slightly changed.  Although at that time it
  was too late.  The lack of needed reform caused the
  Polish king borrowed money under his name to fund the country, which made him
  personally vulnerable even more - which was used against him in the final
  round.
</p>

<p>  At that time Polish society wasn't yet prepared to recognise the real
  threats, nither how the Russians operated.  That has been learned the hard way
  in XIXth and XXth centuries, through national uprisings, with tremendous
  costs (many people were sent to Siberia), many war crimes, or horrific crimes
  in the 50th of XXth century done by communist apparatus.
