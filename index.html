		    <h2 class="section_h">Intro</h2>
		    <p>
		      I am an experienced full stack web developer and have
		      proven myself across a variety of challenges involving
		      designs, implementations, and minimum viable products. 
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      I understand what business needs are and can translate
		      these into prototypes,
		      frameworks and, well, code ;)
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      I am particularly strong in building applications that
		      need to run on real-world mobile networks where LTE
		      speeds are not always available, which is nearly
		      everywhere!
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      <h4>code quality</h4>
		      I am as much curious, open, and learn quickly as I am
		      collaborative. I combine all this with an abstract
		      thinking skill worthy of my academic background, which is
		      PhD in maths. This means my code is neat, and therefore
		      scales easily and is easy to maintain. More importantly
		      however, my code is easily comprehensible for others
		      who join the team. This is super important in agile
		      development with teams that (may) rotate quickly. 
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      <h4>web performance</h4>
		      I have a thorough understanding of web. I have experience
		      pursuing memory leaks, track performance issues in hot code
		      and can code high-performing css animations that run at
		      60FPS on mobile. 
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      <h4>usability, ui & accessibility</h4>
		      Web should be as inclusive as its interactive. Both
		      usability and accessibility is key. Often, good design
		      calls for accessible UI that is easy to navigate with
		      keyboard only input for people with disabilities. I have
		      experience with HTML5 and ARIA (Accessible Reach Internet
		      Applications). 

		      I keeping the original semantic of native elements, this is
		      really important in building usable components by variety
		      of people with different habits from ‘all parts of the
		      web’.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      <h4>maintaince, testability and deadlines</h4>
		      When designing code, I think forward and craft my code in
		      a way that others can pick it up easily. This also means
		      other components can be added on at little effort. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Testing code early is paramount. On tight deadlines
		      there’s often not enough time to write thorough tests.
		      If that’s the case, I go back and write the necessary
		      test, resolve compromises done to meet deadlines. In the
		      long run, wise code reviews always pay back.
		    </p>

		    <p>Some of the most recent projects I worked for:</p>
		    <article>
		      <h3><a class="title" id="rubble" href="http://rubble.tech" target="_blank"><small></small> Rubble</a></h3>
		      <p>
			I have delivered progressive web app based on ReactJS
			and Knockout and relied on custom
			<a href="https://rubble.tech">Rubble</a>
			logic language for the backend as well as Python and
			NodeJS. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			My job as a JavaScript, Python and Rubble engineer was
			to develop applications based on rubble logic programming
			platform, documentation proofreading in close
			cooperation with our CTO.
		      </p>
		      <p>
			One of the challenges up front was to tame a legacy
			code. I have done this by introducing flow - the type
			system from Facebook for JavaScript, so that we at
			rubble could reason about the code with confidence. 

			I turned our flag workflow application into single page
			app which loaeds instantly, with smooth transitions
			between page views, 60fps animations and offline
			support.
		      </p>
		      <p>
			Along the way, which was super exciting for me, I have
			also picked up a new programming paradigm: logic
			programming utilising programming language Rubble,
			which was developed fully in-house. It is a fully
			declarative rule engine and process engine, with
			forward and backward chaining and syntax inspired by
			Prolog. I proofread the documentation and helped to
			debug critical issues. And rebuilded web interface for
			it using websockets for instant communication using
			ReactJS.

			Social platform for sharing enriched hyperlink text connected to LinkedIn <i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i>.
			<p>
			  I worked both as a backend and frontend developer.
			  I implemented pixel perfect designs handed by the
			  design team.  There was a big issue with legacy code
			  at the begining.  After intial struggle with a single
			  page app written by the previous team (using just
			  jQuery) I advocated for using angular and I rewrote
			  the application using modern approach.  This was
			  a difficult decision for managers but after all they
			  undestood the benefits they got - much more reliable
			  code base, well tested - hance more happy workflow
			  for every body in the team and the users.
